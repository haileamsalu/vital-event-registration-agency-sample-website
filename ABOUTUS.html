	  <u><b>Ethiopian Immigration Office</b></u>:
      Prior to having a viable immigration office or process, Ethiopian officials (emperors/princes/warlords) would upon encountering a foreigner decide on a whim, what his fate might be. 
	  According to historical record, most foreigners were denied entry into the country.
      In 1817, Emperor Yohannes put an end to the outdated system and made it a requirement for all foreigners to first be allowed entry, only through the Emperor’s approval.
	  This was given to the governor of the concerned region, allowing the foreigner entry.
	  From region to region, the various governors, upon seeing the seal bearing document would provide safety, food, and shelter till they reached the Emperor’s court.
	  By 1908, Emperor Menelik established the first ministries, and appointed the Ethiopian Ministry of Interior’s Security Directorate to deal with visiting foreigners as well as issuing passports to Ethiopians.
	  This continued until the end of WWII and the expulsion of the fascist Italian occupiers, at which point a new proclamation made the Immigration Department a division of the Ethiopian Ministry of Public Security.
	  With the fall of the monarchy, this system continued till 1980 when it became the Ethiopian Consular and Immigration Division.

	   By 1988, the office had yet another name change, becoming the Ethiopian Immigration and Refugee Affairs Division.
       With the removal of the communist Derg government, the bureau had its name changed twice from the Ethiopian Immigration and Citizenship Department to the Main Department For Immigration & Nationality Affairs.
